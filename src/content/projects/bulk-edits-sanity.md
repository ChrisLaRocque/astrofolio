## Why build this

I work at Sanity, and a decent number of customers had asked if there was a bulk editor interface to make changes to several documents at once. Sanity Studio v2 had the [super pane plugin](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/super-pane), and some other CMS's do offer some type of multi-select + publish/unpublish UI.
