At the start of 2022 I was the lead dev for a website I really loved working on, but had an incredible offer to become the first Solution Engineer for a piece of tech I loved working with. At the time I wasn't even sure what a Solution Engineer did, so I wanted to share my journey in case it helps you developers when deciding on the trajectory of your career.

## What is a Solution Engineer?

A Solution Engineer (SE) is the main technical point of contact for a sales team. As an SE it's your job to:

- **Show customers how your product works:** This takes many forms including product demos, getting hands-on with customer's tech stacks to help them implement, and building out proofs of concept to show how your product integrates with different products/use cases
- **Pair with Account Executives:** Ultimately you are there to serve the Account Executives and make sure they can close their deals. This means joining sales calls to demo the product, answer questions, and make sure you're doing your part to move the deal along.
- **Act as a conduit for customer feedback:** SE's and Account Executives are typically the folks most often talking to existing and prospective customers; as such you are in a unique position to get the right feedback in front of the engineering teams building your product.

## Day to day

## Solution Engineer vs Solution Architect

The titles of Solution Engineer and Solution Architect are sometimes thrown around interchangably, but in my experience they typically are divided into pre-sales (Solution Engineer) and post-sales (Solution Architect).

Typically a Solution Engineer is focused on building out a business case for prospective customers and showing that the product will provide value to the customer; whereas a Solution Architect will work with new and existing customers on implementing the product and ensuring their ongoing success.

## Why make the jump

### Less time "in the code"

### More variation in building proof of concepts
