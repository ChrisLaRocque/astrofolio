title: Switching my site from Nuxt to Astro
description: Astro is tight as fuck. I had built a few small static sites with it, but content collections seemed like a great way to manage my personal site content moving forward.

I can't promise this will truly be a guide on porting a Nuxt site to Astro and all the potential pitfalls one may need to look out for. This is moreso "I rebuilt my Nuxt site in Astro without looking at the old code all that much".

## Why Astro

I honestly really enjoyed working with Nuxt, and would gladly do it again. I've been leaning towards Astro lately, it seems to be a nice evolution of the ideas that drew me to Gatsby (performance as a default)
