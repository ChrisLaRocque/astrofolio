Brightcove has been the home of most of my significant web development experience. This page gives an overview of some of the projects I've done in my time there.

List of things I can remember top of my head:

- [Gatsby v3 migration](/projects/gatsby-v3-migration/)
- Creation of an API endpoint in front of a Lambda function built for validating form data by 3rd party services
- Implementation of standardized UTM tracking across the site, essentially ensuring UTM parameters in the URL are picked up, written to a cookie, maintained throughout the user's session, and then submitted with form data should the user complete one
- Removing i18n in favor of static translations
