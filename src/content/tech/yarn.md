"Yarn: for When NPM is janky". Yarn workspaces are awesome for devloping, really, anything; but I've used them most extensively to build Gatsby plugins.

## Yarn workspaces

Yarn workspaces have been an invaluable tool for me when developing packages and Gatsby plugins. Workspaces allow me to easily test and iterate without the overhead historically required for such development.

## Everything else

Tons of Gatsby and Netlify customers use Yarn as their package manager so I interact with it quite a bit. Its also surprising how many times you can dig yourself out of a problem by forgoing `npm install` for `yarn`.
