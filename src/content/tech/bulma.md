Before I got deep into Tailwind CSS, I compared Bulma and Tailwind as they seemed to have similar buzz at the time of my investigation. I had read (incorrect) things about Tailwind's ability to treeshake unused styles, and found Bulma's more declarative class names preferrable, so I ened up building the first version of my portfolio site using Bulma.
