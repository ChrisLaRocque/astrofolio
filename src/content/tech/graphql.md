I've been using GraphQL as my primary interface for data since 2020.

## Gatsby

If you use the Gatsby datalayer you end up using GraphQL. Gatsby's datalayer was my first professional exposure to GraphQL, and as I mentioned on my page talking about Gatsby I find myself missing it on non-Gatsby projects.

## Apollo

Outisde of Gatsby most of my GraphQL experience is via the Apollo Client. I dig that they provide a schema explorer you can use with any GraphQL API to get a sense of what your data looks like.
