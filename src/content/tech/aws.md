## API Gateway + Lambda

I've used AWS to build internal API endpoints at Brightcove. We used API Gateway + Lambda to create a form validation service that tied into both our own database of known invalid emails as well as a 3rd party service we used to define the quality of each lead coming in.

## Cloudfont + S3

Brightcove.com had an ever-growing list of datasheets to support our marketing campaigns. I used Cloudfront and S3 to create static buckets for these pdfs under a custom subdomain for sharing as part of these campaigns.
