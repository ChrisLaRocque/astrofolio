Nuxt is an excellent tool to work with. I would encourage anyone to check it out, but I think Nuxt is especially great for beginners because of how much _easier_ things feel compared to other frameworks.

## Wifeapedia

Wifeapedia was my first exposure to Nuxt, and I liked it enough to then make my personal portfolio site with it as well. Wifeapedia was built with Nuxt and Tailwind, backed by Contentful.

## LaRocque.dev v1

Liking what I saw when building Wifeapedia, I decided to build my personal site with Nuxt as well. The stack was largely the same as Wifeapedia (Nuxt+Contentful), but using Bulma instead of Tailwind.
