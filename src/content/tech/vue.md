## A nice break from React

When I was building with Gatsby full time I often used side projects to see truly how green the other side of that grass was. Turns out Nuxt/Vue is delightful! I think folks stating React vs Vue has a winner might not have tried to solve the same problem with both, they both have their own strengths when it comes to DX and organization of code, but ultimately both frameworks will do the job you're asking them to.

## Nuxt

Outside of my time at Spartan Race, basically all my Vue work as of late has been in the context of Nuxt.

## Spartan Race

Spartan had a large and talented team of web engineers, who opted at the time (2017), to build their own internal site framework. The team at Spartan settled on Vue as the front-end templating framework with Elixir as the back-of-front for building and compiling everything. As such my Vue experience at Spartan was more akin to 'vanilla' Vue than something like Nuxt.
