Next is obviously the de-facto React framework of the moment and for good reason: developers love the hell out of it. While I personally have never maintained a Next app at scale, my job at both Gatsby and Netlify was to know as much as I possibly could about the framework and its capabilities.

At Gatsby, Netlify, and Sanity I've gotten the chance to pretty regularly stay up to date on Next by building out proof-of-concept apps and demos for customer and my own bag of examples.
