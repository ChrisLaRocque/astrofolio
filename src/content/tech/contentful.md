I think I qualify as an OG Contentful user, I've been building with Contentful since 2016.

## Support

Contentful is basically undeniable as the front-runner in the headless CMS space. Its super easy to find resources around implementing Contentful into basically any tech stack.

## Localization

Contentful makes it so easy to begin translating your content. You can easily add new locales to your content model, and the UI for editing multiple languages is intuitive for users.

## Image CDN

Plenty of CMS providers include their own image CDN as part of their product offering, but in my experience Contentful is the only one that 'just works' as you'd expect it: when you fetch the image the CDN URL comes back.
