## Gatsby Plugins

Gatsby plugins are typically mostly written in Node. I've written plugins for sourcing data from an API into their GraphQL datalayer, transforming Markdoc files into actual pages, translating pages and routes, creating themed layouts and component libraries, and much more I'm forgetting.

## Serverless functions

The project 'Lambda sitemap generator' listed in related projects is probably the most isolated case of writing a serverless function in Node, but I've written other mostly back-of-front API routes in Next, Gatsby, and Netlify apps to cover data fetching, personalization, auth state, and more that aren't coming to mind right now.
