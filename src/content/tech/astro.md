Astro is tight as hell.

Astro delivers on what initially drew me to Gatsby: performance as the default.

## DX

I think most frameworks looks to Next.js as a model for defining their own DX (for good reason!). As such if I try a framework out and the DX is 'next-ish' I consider that a win/to be expected.

The new 'Content Collections' feature basically prompted me to feel comfortable shifting my personal site off Contentful.

### The `Astro` global

Is also tight as hell. Its awesome to be able to get the page URL anywhere in your components, as well as a host of other helpful info!

## Performance

Every site I've build with Astro has been in the 90s of page performance. Some drawbacks: the Astro `<Picture>` defaults to lazy-loading images, even above the fold, but this is easily overridable.
