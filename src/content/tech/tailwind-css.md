I love Tailwind. I also love observing the internet fighting about Tailwind.

## Everything I've built in the last year has been with Tailwind

It's just so dope for being able to quickly and easily spin up MVPs for customers with as little boilerplate as possible. I also find it nice that if anything did go wrong with Tailwind itself, my markup won't break.

## LaRocque.dev v2

This whole site was styled with the base Tailwind classes.

## Wifeapedia

Wifeapedia was my first experience with Tailwind, and planted the seed that it could be incredibly powerful for building sites quickly.
