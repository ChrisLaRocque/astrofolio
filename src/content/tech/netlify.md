## Bringing the future to me

Netlify in my opinion has dramatically shifted devops forward and allowed idiots like myself to get sites built and hosted with minimal friction. I don't need to create my own Route 53/Loadbalancer/Amplify stack to host a site, I just point Netlify to my Git repository, it figures out the framework + build command, and I have a hosted website in usually under a minute.

## All the other 'stuff'

When building simple apps, or using frameworks still working out all the kinks, all the things that 'surround' your Netlify site have proven invaluable to me. The main things that have saved my skin? Forms, Redirects, and Functions

### Forms

Netlify provides a simple way to collect form data and view it in your site dashboard UI. Huge time to live saver as you can skip setting up a more advanced CRM/user database until its needed.

### Redirects

Huge time saver. Most frameworks include their own way to handle redirects, but if all your sites are hosted on Netlify you can just learn their syntax and be off to the races.

### Functions

Again sometimes simple apps or frameworks starting out don't provide a way to run API routes alongside your front-end. Netlify functions make it trivial to get Lambda functions spun up alongside your front-end.
